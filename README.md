## Lyrics

```
i rise and abide yeah
i rise and abide yeah

god-shaped hole, the barren role of (the hanged court)-> (all the damned) in a fallen 
and failed creation all white you see the light of the long dead stars (for all the) 
your existence is nothing but an echo of a dying god
i keep'em rites in the scrolls long forgotten my persistence 
as the keys to pry wide open eyes in the fodder dulled 
conscience and free will alike arise and abide nothing left to discover

so i rise and abide to the ancient process
we the hanged kings and queens
arise and abide to the ancient order
we the hanged kings and queens

arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah

god-shaped hole, the barren role of all the damned in a fallen 
and failed creation all white you see the light of the long dead stars (for all the) 
your existence is nothing but an echo of a dying god
i keep'em rites in the scrolls long forgotten my persistence 
as the keys to pry wide open eyes in the fodder dulled 
conscience and free will alike arise and abide nothing left to discover



"a god-shaped hole
the barren desolation (role of the damned in) of a fallen 
and failed creation ...

you see the light of the long dead stars
your existence is nothing 
but an echo of a dying god 

you keep'em rites in a scroll long forgotten  
your persistence as the keys
to pry widee open eyes in the fodder

dulled conscience and free will
alikeee (arise and abide)
nothing left to discover
so arise and
abide to the ancient process

arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
hanged king
oh hanged king

scream the unseen converges 
surrounds you 
and it tightens like a noose"

omega omega?
