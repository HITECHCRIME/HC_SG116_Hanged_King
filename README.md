## Lyrics

```
"a god-shaped hole
the barren role of all the damned 
in a fallen and failed creation ...

you see the light of the long dead stars
your existence is nothing 
but an echo of a dying god 

you keep'em rites in the scrolls long forgotten  
your persistence as the keys
to pry widee open eyes in the fodder

dulled conscience and free will
alikeee (arise and abide)
nothing left to discover
so arise and
abide to the ancient process
abide to the ancient order

arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah



"a god-shaped hole
the barren desolation (role of the damned in) of a fallen 
and failed creation ...

you see the light of the long dead stars
your existence is nothing 
but an echo of a dying god 

you keep'em rites in a scroll long forgotten  
your persistence as the keys
to pry widee open eyes in the fodder

dulled conscience and free will
alikeee (arise and abide)
nothing left to discover
so arise and
abide to the ancient process

arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
arise and abide yeah
hanged king
oh hanged king

scream the unseen converges 
surrounds you 
and it tightens like a noose"

```
